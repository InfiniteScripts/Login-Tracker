This plugin tracks all your users logins then records the time, IP address, City and State where they logged in from.

== Description ==

Login Tracker is used to monitor the users of your site. I originally wrote it to catch users sharing their paid memberships but have found a number of uses for the info. You'll need to register for an IPinfodDB APIkey if you wish to use the City / State features. You'll enter this in the Login Tracker settings page. Login Tracker adds a sortable column in the users table with last login time and a link to a filter-able table of all that users logins. You can export that table as a CSV. You can also generate lists of logins from a time range from the main plugin page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
